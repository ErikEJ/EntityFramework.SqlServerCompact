This project is the Entity Framework 7 SQL Server Compact provider.

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/y7eyabev603qgy7h/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ErikEJ/entityframework-sqlservercompact/branch/master)

This provider is mainly intended for desktop applications under .NET 4.5 (Console, WPF, WinForms and Services), but may also work under ASP.NET 4 and 5 when using the full .NET runtime. It does **not** work under the DNX runtime.

See the [Wiki pages](https://github.com/ErikEJ/EntityFramework.SqlServerCompact/wiki) for information on how to get started with the source code and the NuGet package.

You can find the latest build on the [MyGet feed](https://www.myget.org/gallery/ef7-sqlce)
