# EntityFramework.SqlServerCompact
This project intends to implement a EntityFramework 7 SQL Server Compact provider.

This provider is mainly intended for desktop applications under .NET 4.5 (Console, WPF, WinForms and Services), but may also work under ASP.NET when using the full .NET runtime.

Currently a work in progress, but pull requests accepted.

Intention is to implement bit by bit, while adding current base functional tests one by one.
