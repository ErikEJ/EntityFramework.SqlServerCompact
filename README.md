# EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServerCompact
This project is the Entity Framework Core SQL Server Compact providers for SQL Server Compact 4.0 and 3.5 SP2.

This project is archived, as SQL Server Compact is out of support.

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/y7eyabev603qgy7h/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ErikEJ/entityframework-sqlservercompact/branch/master)

This provider is mainly intended for desktop applications under .NET 4.6.1 (Console, WPF, WinForms and Services), but may also work under ASP.NET 4.6.1 and ASP.NET Core 2.0 when using the full .NET Framework runtime. It does **not** work under the .NET Core runtime.

See the [Wiki pages](https://github.com/ErikEJ/EntityFramework.SqlServerCompact/wiki) for information on how to get started with the source code and the NuGet package.
