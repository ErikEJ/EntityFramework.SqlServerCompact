# EntityFramework.SqlServerCompact
This project is EntityFramework 7 SQL Server Compact provider.

This provider is mainly intended for desktop applications under .NET 4.5 (Console, WPF, WinForms and Services), but may also work under ASP.NET 4 and 5 when using the full .NET runtime.

Pull requests are most welcome!
